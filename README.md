# pre-commit for pyright
Wrapper to enable pre-commit hook usage for pyright

## Usage:
In your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` include the following block.

```
-   repo: https://github.com/necaris/pre-commit-pyright
    rev: '1.1.306'
    hooks:
    -   id: pyright
```

If you have a `pyrightconfiguration.json` defined, this hook will honor it.
